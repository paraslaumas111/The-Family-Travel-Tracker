#About
The Family Travel Tracker (Tech Stack: PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js)
 • Developed an interactive and visually appealing website for families to track and display their travel history across the
 globe.

 history is uniquely highlighted in a color of their choice, offering a personalized visual representation.
 • Enabled users to add an unlimited number of family members, ensuring the platform accommodates diverse family sizes.
 Each member’s travel data is managed individually.
 • Provided full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities, allowing users to manage their travel data with ease
 and flexibility.
 • Utilized PostgreSQL for reliable data storage, with pgAdmin4 employed for database management. Implemented complex
 SQL queries, including inner and equi-joins, to handle many-to-many relationships between related tables efficiently.
